# Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test changes in `openamr-platform-sw` before opening a pull request.

The project is a ROS 2 robotics stack, so testing has several levels:

- documentation checks
- package builds
- package tests
- launch smoke tests
- simulation behavior checks
- docking-specific checks

Use the smallest test set that matches your change, but always record what you ran in the pull request.

---

## 1. Before You Start

Use Ubuntu 24.04 with ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic.

From the ROS 2 workspace:

```bash
cd openamr-platform-sw/ros2
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
```

If the workspace has already been built:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

If `install/setup.bash` does not exist, build first:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

Check that the project packages are visible:

```bash
ros2 pkg list | grep openamrobot
```

Expected packages include:

```text
openamrobot_description
openamrobot_docking
openamrobot_gazebo
openamrobot_nav2
```

---

## 2. Choose the Right Test Level

| Change type | Minimum recommended checks |
|---|---|
| Documentation only | Read the changed docs, check links/commands, run `git diff --check` |
| Git/contributing docs | Check examples use the right repo, branch, DCO, and PR target |
| Package README/docs | Build the related package if commands or package names changed |
| Launch files | Build, source, run the affected launch smoke test |
| URDF/xacro or meshes | Build, launch Gazebo, confirm robot spawns and TF exists |
| Gazebo bridge/worlds | Build, launch Gazebo, check `/clock`, `/scan`, `/odom`, `/rgb_image`, `/cmd_vel` |
| Nav2 config/maps | Build, launch Gazebo + Nav2, send or inspect a navigation goal |
| Docking code/config | Build, launch full stack, trigger dock and undock |
| C++ node changes | Build package, run package tests, run launch that uses the node |
| Python node changes | Build package, run package tests if available, run launch that uses the script |

---

## 3. Documentation Checks

For documentation-only changes, run from the repository root:

```bash
git status
git diff --check
```

Review the changed files:

```bash
git diff
```

Check:

- links point to real files
- commands use the correct workspace path: `openamr-platform-sw/ros2`
- commands source ROS 2 before ROS commands
- commands source `install/setup.bash` after building
- generated folders such as `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` are not committed

For docs that mention topics or launch files, verify names against the repo:

```bash
find ros2/src -path "*launch*" -type f
find ros2/src -name package.xml
```

---

## 4. Build Checks

Build the full current simulation stack:

```bash
cd openamr-platform-sw/ros2
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

Build only one package:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select openamrobot_nav2
```

Build a package and everything needed up to it:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to openamrobot_docking
```

Use `--packages-up-to openamrobot_docking` for most docking, simulation, and launch-composition changes.

---

## 5. Package Tests

Run all available package tests:

```bash
cd openamr-platform-sw/ros2
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon test
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Run tests for one package:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select openamrobot_nav2
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Run tests for the packages that currently include Python lint/test files:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select openamrobot_description openamrobot_gazebo openamrobot_nav2
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Current test coverage:

| Package | Current test type |
|---|---|
| `openamrobot_description` | Python package lint tests: copyright, flake8, pep257 |
| `openamrobot_gazebo` | Python package lint tests: copyright, flake8, pep257 |
| `openamrobot_nav2` | Python package lint tests: copyright, flake8, pep257 |
| `openamrobot_docking` | Build coverage for C++ node and installed Python scripts; no dedicated test files yet |

If `colcon test` fails, inspect:

```bash
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Then fix the failure before opening the PR, or explain clearly why the failure is unrelated.

---

## 6. Launch Smoke Tests

Launch smoke tests prove that the main runtime layers still start.

Use a sourced terminal:

```bash
cd openamr-platform-sw/ros2
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
```

### One-Command Simulation Smoke Test

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py
```

On slower machines:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py nav2_delay:=10 docking_delay:=22
```

Headless mode:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py gazebo_gui:=false use_rviz:=false
```

Expected:

- Gazebo starts or headless server starts.
- Robot spawns.
- `/clock`, `/scan`, `/odom`, `/tf`, and `/rgb_image` appear.
- Nav2 starts after the configured delay.
- Docking layer starts after Nav2.
- No package lookup errors appear.

### Three-Layer Smoke Test

Use three sourced terminals.

Terminal 1:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_gazebo gz_simulator.launch.py
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_nav2 sim_bringup_launch.py
```

Terminal 3:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking openamrobot_docking.launch.py
```

Expected:

- Gazebo owns `/clock` and sensor topics.
- Nav2 localizes on the map.
- Docking starts AprilTag detection and the dock trigger node.

---

## 7. Runtime Topic Checks

After launching the simulation, check core topics:

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /clock --once
ros2 topic echo /scan --once
ros2 topic echo /odom --once
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
```

Check robot model and static transforms:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /robot_description --once --qos-durability transient_local
ros2 topic echo /tf_static --once --qos-durability transient_local
```

Check TF:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo base_link camera_optical_frame
```

Check Nav2 action servers:

```bash
ros2 action list
```

Expected action:

```text
/navigate_to_pose
```

---

## 8. Gazebo and Bridge Checks

Use these checks after Gazebo is running.

Check sensor topics:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /scan --once
ros2 topic hz /rgb_image
ros2 topic echo /odom --once
```

Check the velocity command bridge:

```bash
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
```

The Gazebo bridge should be connected to `/cmd_vel`.

Manual movement test:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.1}}" --once
```

Expected:

- Robot moves forward briefly in Gazebo.
- `/odom` changes.

Use a small velocity and stop the test if the robot behaves unexpectedly.

---

## 9. Navigation Checks

After Gazebo and Nav2 are running:

```bash
ros2 action list
ros2 topic echo /map --once --qos-durability transient_local
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
```

In RViz:

- fixed frame should be `map`
- robot should appear on the map
- lidar scan should line up with the map
- a simple 2D goal should produce a plan

If testing without RViz, check that `/navigate_to_pose` exists and Nav2 logs show active lifecycle nodes.

---

## 10. Docking Checks

After the full stack is running, trigger docking:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /dock_trigger std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once
```

Expected:

- `dock_trigger.py` receives the trigger.
- Phase 1 sends a Nav2 goal to the staging pose.
- AprilTag detections are available.
- The robot aligns and approaches the dock.

Check AprilTag topics:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /rgb_image
ros2 topic hz /camera_info
ros2 topic hz /camera_info_synced
ros2 topic echo /apriltag/detections --once
```

Check dock pose:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /detected_dock_pose --once
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map charging_dock_apriltag
```

Test undock:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /undock_robot std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once
```

Expected:

- Robot reverses away from the dock.
- Robot rotates to face away from the dock.

For deeper docking diagnostics, see:

```text
ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/09_troubleshooting.md
```

## 11. What to Test by Change Area

### Documentation Change

Run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Also manually review changed commands, links, and package names.

### Robot Description Change

Run:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select openamrobot_description
colcon test --packages-select openamrobot_description
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Then launch Gazebo and confirm the robot spawns.

### Gazebo Change

Run:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to openamrobot_gazebo
ros2 launch openamrobot_gazebo gz_simulator.launch.py
```

Check:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /clock --once
ros2 topic echo /scan --once
ros2 topic echo /odom --once
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
```

### Nav2 Change

Run:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to openamrobot_nav2
colcon test --packages-select openamrobot_nav2
colcon test-result --verbose
ros2 launch openamrobot_nav2 sim_bringup_launch.py
```

Check `/navigate_to_pose`, `/map`, and `map -> base_link`.

### Docking Change

Run:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to openamrobot_docking
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py
```

Then trigger:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /dock_trigger std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once
ros2 topic pub /undock_robot std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once
```

---

## 12. Pull Request Test Plan

Every pull request should include a test plan.

Good examples:

```text
## Test plan

- Ran `git diff --check`
- Built from `ros2/` with `colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to openamrobot_docking`
- Ran `colcon test --packages-select openamrobot_description openamrobot_gazebo openamrobot_nav2`
- Launched `ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py gazebo_gui:=false use_rviz:=false`
- Triggered docking with `/dock_trigger`; robot reached staging and started AprilTag alignment
```

For documentation-only changes:

```text
## Test plan

- Ran `git diff --check`
- Manually reviewed links and commands in the changed docs
```

If you did not run a test, say so and explain why:

```text
## Test plan

- Not run: simulation smoke test requires Gazebo display access
```

---

## 13. Common Testing Mistakes

Avoid these:

- running `colcon build` from the repository root instead of `ros2/`
- forgetting `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash`
- forgetting `source install/setup.bash` after building
- running ROS commands without `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`
- testing only the package build but not the launch file that uses it
- committing generated folders such as `ros2/build/`, `ros2/install/`, or `ros2/log/`
- opening a PR without a test plan
