## Quickstart — simulation, navigation & docking

> This walks you from a fresh install through the full stack: the Gazebo simulation, Nav2 navigation, and the AprilTag dock/undock pipeline. It is what runs end-to-end today — the repo is broader than this (see [Repository layout](#repository-layout)), but everything below works now.

Choose the setup path that suits you:

| | [Option A — Docker](#option-a--docker-recommended) | [Option B — Manual install](#option-b--manual-install-ubuntu-2404) |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | New contributors, quick onboarding | Native development, hardware work |
| **Requires** | Docker + Docker Compose | Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS 2 Jazzy |
| **Effort** | ~5 min | ~30–60 min |
| **GUI (Gazebo/RViz)** | Yes (X11 passthrough) | Yes |

---

## Option A — Docker (recommended)

### What is Docker?

Docker is a tool that packages software and all its dependencies into a self-contained **container** — like a lightweight virtual machine that shares your kernel. You don't install ROS 2, Gazebo, or Nav2 on your host; Docker does it inside the container automatically. Every contributor runs the exact same environment, so _"it works on my machine"_ stops being a problem.

**You only need two things installed on your host:** Docker and Docker Compose.

### A.1 Install Docker

Follow the official install guide for your OS: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>

Then install the Compose plugin (usually bundled with Docker Desktop; on Linux run):

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify everything works:

```bash
docker --version          # Docker version 24.x or later
docker compose version    # Docker Compose version v2.x or later
docker info               # confirms your user can talk to the Docker daemon
```

> **Permission tip:** add yourself to the `docker` group so you don't need `sudo` on every command:
> ```bash
> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
> newgrp docker
> ```
> If `docker info` still says `permission denied`, fully log out and log back in
> (or reboot) so the new group membership is applied.

### A.2 Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-sw.git
cd openamr-platform-sw
```

### A.3 Allow Docker to open GUI windows

Gazebo and RViz need access to your host display:

```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

Run this once per host session (or add it to your `~/.bashrc`).

### A.4 Build the image

Run Compose commands from the repository root, where `docker-compose.yml` lives:

```bash
cd openamr-platform-sw
docker compose build
```

If you see `no configuration file provided: not found`, you are in the wrong
directory; `cd` back to the repository root and rerun the command.

This downloads the ROS 2 Jazzy base image and installs every dependency. First build takes **5–10 minutes**; subsequent builds reuse the cached layers and are nearly instant.

### A.5 Launch the full simulation stack

```bash
docker compose run --rm openamr \
  ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py
```

Gazebo and RViz windows will appear on your host screen. Jump to [Drive the robot](#drive-the-robot) once the stack is up.

### A.6 Open an interactive shell (for development)

```bash
docker compose run --rm openamr bash
```

The `ros2/src/` directory is **bind-mounted** into the container — edits you make on the host are immediately visible inside, and vice versa. After changing code, rebuild only the affected package:

```bash
# inside the container
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select openamrobot_docking
source install/setup.bash
```

No need to rebuild the Docker image unless you add a new apt dependency to the `Dockerfile`.

### A.7 Run layers separately (optional)

Same as the manual path below — just prefix each command with `docker compose run --rm openamr`:

```bash
docker compose run --rm openamr ros2 launch openamrobot_gazebo gz_simulator.launch.py
docker compose run --rm openamr ros2 launch openamrobot_nav2 sim_bringup_launch.py
docker compose run --rm openamr ros2 launch openamrobot_docking openamrobot_docking.launch.py
```

All containers use `network_mode: host`, so DDS discovery works between them automatically.

> **CycloneDDS:** `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` is already set in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) — you don't need to do anything extra. See [Why CycloneDDS](#why-cyclonedds) for the reason.

> **NVIDIA GPU:** If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want hardware-accelerated Gazebo rendering, install [`nvidia-container-toolkit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) and uncomment the `openamr-gpu` service in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml).

---

## Option B — Manual install (Ubuntu 24.04)

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)**, native install (Gazebo Harmonic needs a Linux display server).
- **ROS 2 Jazzy** installed system-wide.
- **Gazebo Harmonic** (`gz-sim 8.x`), provided by `ros-jazzy-ros-gz-sim`.

One-time package install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup ros-jazzy-nav2-amcl ros-jazzy-nav2-lifecycle-manager \
  ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox ros-jazzy-laser-filters \
  ros-jazzy-apriltag-ros ros-jazzy-image-proc \
  ros-jazzy-ros-gz-sim ros-jazzy-ros-gz-bridge ros-jazzy-ros-gz-image \
  ros-jazzy-robot-state-publisher ros-jazzy-joint-state-publisher \
  ros-jazzy-tf2-ros ros-jazzy-tf2-tools ros-jazzy-tf2-geometry-msgs \
  ros-jazzy-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp ros-jazzy-topic-tools ros-jazzy-rviz2 \
  python3-colcon-common-extensions

# CycloneDDS is required — see "Why CycloneDDS" below.
echo 'export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Clone + build

The colcon workspace is the **`ros2/`** sub-directory (it is the folder that contains `src/`), so build from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-sw.git
cd openamr-platform-sw/ros2          # the colcon workspace root
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install        # creates build/ install/ log/ inside ros2/
source install/setup.bash
```

Sourcing does **not** carry over between terminals, so in **every** new terminal run (from `ros2/`):

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
```

### 3a. Launch everything with one command

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py
```

This brings up the whole stack in the right order with a delay between each layer (Gazebo, then Nav2 at +8 s, then docking at +16 s). On a slower machine, widen the gaps:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py nav2_delay:=10 docking_delay:=22
```

For headless simulation without Gazebo GUI or RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py gazebo_gui:=false use_rviz:=false
```

### 3b. …or run the three layers separately

Useful while tuning or restarting one layer without bringing the others down. **The order matters** — each layer depends on the one before it, so start them top to bottom (one sourced terminal each):

```bash
# 1. Simulation — Gazebo + robot + ros<->gz bridge.
#    Must be first: it owns /clock, spawns the robot, and bridges /scan,
#    /odom, /rgb_image, /cmd_vel. Nothing else has data until this is up.
ros2 launch openamrobot_gazebo gz_simulator.launch.py

# 2. Navigation + RViz — Nav2 + AMCL on the saved map + the RViz view.
#    Needs the simulator's /scan, /odom and /clock to localize the robot
#    on the map; RViz lets you watch it and send "2D Goal Pose" goals.
ros2 launch openamrobot_nav2 sim_bringup_launch.py

# 3. Docking — AprilTag detection + the dock/undock sequencer.
#    Needs the camera (/rgb_image) from layer 1 and the navigate_to_pose
#    action + TF tree from layer 2.
ros2 launch openamrobot_docking openamrobot_docking.launch.py
```

> If a launch fails with `package 'openamrobot_...' not found`, you forgot `source install/setup.bash` in that terminal.

---

## 4. Drive the robot

> Both paths (Docker and manual) end up here once the stack is running.

Wait ~10 s for Nav2 to localize, then from any sourced terminal (or `docker compose run --rm openamr bash` if using Docker):

```bash
ros2 topic pub /dock_trigger  std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once   # dock
ros2 topic pub /undock_robot  std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once   # undock: reverse 1.5 m + spin 180°
```

You can also send a navigation goal (RViz **"2D Goal Pose"**, or a `PoseStamped` on `/goal_pose`): if the robot is docked it **undocks first**, then drives to the goal. The robot navigates to a staging zone, scans for the AprilTag, aligns perpendicular to it, then drives onto the dock — ending ~90 cm from the tag, perpendicular.

For a step-by-step walkthrough with diagnostics: [`ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/01_quickstart.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/01_quickstart.md).

---

## Why CycloneDDS

The default Jazzy RMW (FastDDS) has a Python-side crash bug that makes the docking sequencer (`dock_trigger.py`) exit silently when sending Nav2 action goals. CycloneDDS must be used instead.

**Docker (Option A):** already handled — `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` is set in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Nothing to do.

**Manual install (Option B):** add it to your shell profile once:

```bash
echo 'export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

The four `(placeholder)` packages are folder + `README.md` markers; they don't build yet. They reserve the architectural slot for upcoming real-robot work. The reserved root directories currently hold only `.gitkeep` markers — engineering docs and configs live next to their code under `ros2/src/`.

---

## Package responsibilities

Strict separation of concerns:

| Package | Owns | Does NOT own |
|---|---|---|
| `openamrobot_description` | Robot URDF, meshes, mass/inertia, Gazebo sensor plugin tags | Worlds, navigation, docking |
| `openamrobot_gazebo` | Simulator bringup, ros↔gz bridge, generic + scenario worlds | Robot model, navigation, docking |
| `openamrobot_nav2` | Nav2 params, AMCL on a saved map, RViz layout | Gazebo, docking |
| `openamrobot_docking` | AprilTag detection, dock model, dock/undock sequencer, the one-command sim bringup | Robot, simulator, navigation stack |

Each package may **reference** sibling packages at launch composition time (`FindPackageShare` + `IncludeLaunchDescription`), but **must not duplicate** their files.

---

## Architecture — the `/cmd_vel` flow

In the docking simulation, the chain from a velocity command to the wheels is:

```
dock_trigger.py / Nav2 controller       ──>  /cmd_vel
                                              │
                                              ▼
                          ros_gz_bridge  ──>  gz /cmd_vel
                                              │
                                              ▼
                          DiffDrive plugin    (Gazebo, applies torques to joints)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                          ODE contact solver  (friction, the robot moves)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                          gz odom + tf  ──>   /odom, /tf  (via bridge)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                          robot_state_publisher fills in base_link → camera_optical_frame → …
```

If any link breaks, the robot stops moving. The most common failure mode is the bridge not forwarding `/cmd_vel` (verify with `ros2 topic info /cmd_vel`). The full TF chain on top of this is in [`ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/03_tf_frames.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/03_tf_frames.md).

---

## Per-package documentation

Each package ships its own README. The deep engineering docs live under [`ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/`](ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/) (numbered files: overview, quickstart, architecture, TF chain, AprilTag setup, parameters, troubleshooting, lessons learned).

| Package | README |
|---|---|
| `openamrobot_description` | [`ros2/src/openamrobot_description/README.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_description/README.md) |
| `openamrobot_gazebo` | [`ros2/src/openamrobot_gazebo/README.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_gazebo/README.md) |
| `openamrobot_nav2` | [`ros2/src/openamrobot_nav2/README.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_nav2/README.md) |
| `openamrobot_docking` | [`ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/README.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/README.md) |

For the docking pipeline specifically, start with [`docs/01_quickstart.md`](ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/docs/01_quickstart.md).

---

## Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] **Obstacle-aware dock & undock.** Today the dock and undock phases bypass Nav2 — `dock_trigger.py` publishes straight to `/cmd_vel`, so the lidar, costmaps and collision monitor are not in the loop during those maneuvers. Bring obstacle awareness back into the dock/undock phases (lidar-based collision checking and/or routing the maneuver through Nav2) so the robot stops or replans if something enters its path while approaching or leaving the dock.
- [ ] **Higher-precision docking (target ~99.99% reliability).** The current 4-phase approach lands within a few centimetres laterally and ~1° in yaw, which is good but not yet production-grade. Investigate a more reliable approach (e.g. tighter visual-servo final stage, multi-tag or larger-tag geometry, better camera calibration, sensor fusion) so docking succeeds essentially every time across lighting and pose variations.

---

## Related repositories (organisation-level)

This repo is the **software** side of the OpenAMRobot platform. Sister repositories cover the rest of the stack:

| Repo | Contents |
|---|---|
| `openamr-platform-hw` | Mechanical CAD, BOM, wiring, electrical |
| `openamr-platform-fw` | Embedded firmware (STM32, Teensy, ESP32) |
| `openamrobot-docs` | Organisation-wide user-facing documentation |
| `openamrobot-interfaces` | Shared ROS 2 messages, services, actions |
| `openamrobot-comm` | Shared communication contracts |
| `openamrobot-ui` | Operator interface (publishes `/dock_trigger` on docking) |

---

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Key rule: a contribution should modify **only the package or directory related to the task**. For example, an autodocking change should normally touch only `ros2/src/openamrobot_docking/`. If it *requires* a touch in a sibling package (e.g. a remap that the docking gate depends on), describe the necessity in the PR.
