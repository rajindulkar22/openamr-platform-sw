"""
One-shot bringup for the whole docking simulation.

Starts the three layers that are otherwise run in three separate terminals,
in the right order and with a delay between each so every layer is up before
the next one needs it:

    1. openamrobot_gazebo  gz_simulator.launch.py   (Gazebo + robot + ros<->gz bridge)
    2. openamrobot_nav2    sim_bringup_launch.py    (Nav2 + AMCL + map + RViz)
    3. openamrobot_docking openamrobot_docking.launch.py  (apriltag + docking sequencer)

Usage:

    ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py

Then trigger docking from any sourced terminal:

    ros2 topic pub /dock_trigger std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}" --once

The three individual launches still work on their own if you want to start /
restart one layer at a time (e.g. while tuning):

    ros2 launch openamrobot_gazebo  gz_simulator.launch.py
    ros2 launch openamrobot_nav2    sim_bringup_launch.py
    ros2 launch openamrobot_docking openamrobot_docking.launch.py

Startup timing is configurable if your machine needs more (or less) warm-up:

    ros2 launch openamrobot_docking bringup_sim.launch.py nav2_delay:=10 docking_delay:=20
