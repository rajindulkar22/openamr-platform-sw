## What this package does

`openamrobot_docking` is a ROS 2 (Jazzy) package that makes a differential-drive robot autonomously dock onto a charging station marked with a **3-tag AprilTag bundle** (family 36h11, IDs **0, 1, 2** — outer tags at ±0.45 m from the centre on a horizontal line, all on 0.20 m × 0.20 m panels with a 0.16 m black-square edge).

In one sentence: **publish a `Bool true` on `/dock_trigger`, the robot drives to a staging zone near the dock, estimates the dock's surface normal from the wide-baseline bundle, refines its position with a camera-centric approach, and engages perpendicular to the tag at a configurable distance — aligned and ready to charge.**

This package handles:

- AprilTag bundle detection from a simulated camera (`apriltag_ros` configured for tags 0/1/2 → frames `charging_dock_tag_0`, `charging_dock_tag_1`, `charging_dock_tag_2`)
- TF transformation of the centre tag's pose into the `map` frame (`detected_dock_pose_publisher` publishes `/detected_dock_pose` from `charging_dock_tag_1` at 10 Hz)
- Navigation to a *staging* pose in front of the dock (via Nav2's `NavigateToPose` action)
- A **multi-phase docking sequencer** that takes over after staging:
  - in-camera centring scan,
  - dock-normal estimation from the **outer tags' wide baseline** (gives a stable perpendicular axis independent of single-tag yaw jitter),
  - back-off if the robot arrived too close, then a camera-frame goto-point-on-normal,
  - a re-verification of the normal against the agreed tolerance,
  - a final approach that pure-pursuits the dock normal, then pure-pursuits a dock line that lives permanently in the **odom** frame (refined by fresh tags looked up in odom), stopping on the **front lidar** at the dock face.
- An **undock** maneuver (reverse a configurable distance, then 180° in-place spin) plus an undock-before-navigate gate on `/goal_pose`.

This package does **not** handle:

- Battery monitoring or charge-state detection — needs separate code
- Map building — assume Nav2 + AMCL is running on a pre-built map (or SLAM in mapping mode)
- The decision of *when* to dock — must be triggered externally (UI, scheduler, behaviour tree, etc.)

## Why this design

A single AprilTag's pose estimate has a well-known **yaw ambiguity** ("flip"): the small planar square gives two near-equal `solvePnP` solutions and a jittery surface-normal estimate, especially when viewed off-axis. A robot steered on a single noisy tag wobbles at the dock.

The current pipeline addresses this with **three** complementary mechanisms:

1. **3-tag bundle for a wide-baseline normal** — the outer tags (`charging_dock_tag_0` at `y = −0.45 m`, `charging_dock_tag_2` at `y = +0.45 m`) span 90 cm horizontally. The vector between them defines the dock surface direction, and its perpendicular is the dock normal. A 90 cm baseline locks the normal far more tightly than any single-tag PnP — the geometry is what makes the orientation stable, not the filtering.
2. **Camera-centric closed loop** — the sequencer expresses control in the camera/robot frame (image-frame angle to the centre tag, depth from the bundle pose) rather than in `map`. This makes the result independent of `map → odom` drift: if the wheels slip mid-approach, the next bundle observation corrects in the camera frame immediately, without an odometry-induced steady-state error.
3. **Odom-anchored line + lidar stop** — the dock reference line lives permanently in the `odom` frame (`unified_odom_line: true`); fresh tags are looked up lag-correct in odom and refine it (the centre tag alone re-anchors it, no tag → coast on odometry), and the final stop is LIDAR-controlled at the dock face rather than a depth-triggered visual servo (`omega = −visual_servo_kp · atan2(X, Z)` in the camera optical frame). Freezing kills the close-range zig-zag caused by noisy near-field PnP, while the visual corrector keeps the centre tag aligned with the image centre — which is geometrically equivalent to driving straight onto the dock.

In simulation this delivers ~1–2 cm of lateral error and ~1° of yaw error at the dock. The longer research arc — vendor-agnostic precision target, sensing-method catalogue, validation protocol, failure modes, calibration — is in [`14_docking_research.md`](14_docking_research.md).
